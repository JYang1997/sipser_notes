> **Definition**
> A **finite automaton** is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma , \delta, q_0 F)$, where
> 1. Q is a finite set called the **states**.
> 2.  $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the **alphabets**.
> 3. $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the transition function.
> 4. $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state
> 5. $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of  accept states.

Finite automaton is the recognizers for equivalent **Regular Languages**. Another words, Regular Languages are exactly the languages accepted by (non)deterministic finite automata;


> **Definition**
>  Formal definition for **Regular Expression** if R is 
>  1. $a$ for some $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$,
>  2. $\epsilon$
> 3. $\empty$
> 4. $(R_1 \cup R_2 )$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions,
> 5. (R 1 ◦ R 2 ), where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions, or
> 6. $(R_1^* )$, where $R_1$ is a regular expression.
In items 1 and 2, the regular expressions a and ε represent the
languages {a} and {ε}, respectively. In item 3, the regular expres-
sion ∅ represents the empty language. In items 4, 5, and 6, the
expressions represent the languages obtained by taking the union
or concatenation of the languages R 1 and R 2 , or the star of the
language R 1 , respectively.
 
 ### Differentiating Non-Regular Languages 
To differentiating  regularities, we can use **Pumping lemma**

>**Definition**
> CFG is 4-tuple $(V, \Sigma, R, S)$
> 1. V is a finite set called variables
> 2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set called terminals (disjoint from V).
> 3. R is a finite set of rules
> 4. $S \in V$ is a start varible.

>**Definition**
> A **context free laguage** is any language that is generated by a context-free grammar. (CFL)



>**Definition**
>A string $\omega$ is derived **ambiguously** in context-free grammar G if it has two or more different **leftmost derivations**. Grammar G is ambiguous if it generates some string ambiguously.
> 
> ***leftmost derivation**:  if at every step the leftmost remaining variable is the one replaced.

>**Theorem**
> Any CFL is generated by a CFG in Chomsky normal form
