Finite automaton is the recognizers for equivalent **Regular Languages**. Another words, Regular Languages are exactly the languages accepted by (non)deterministic finite automata;

### Differentiating Non-Regular Languages

To differentiating regularities, we can use **Pumping lemma**

# Chapter 2 Context Free Language

### TODO:

```
1. show inherently ambiguous
2. 

```

> **Definition**  
> CFG is 4-tuple (V,Σ,R,S)(V, \\Sigma, R, S)(V,Σ,R,S)
> 
> 1.  V is a finite set called variables
> 2.  Σ\\SigmaΣ is a finite set called terminals (disjoint from V).
> 3.  R is a finite set of rules
> 4.  S∈VS \\in VS∈V is a start varible.

> **Definition**  
> A **context free laguage** is any language that is generated by a context-free grammar. (CFL)

> **Definition**  
> A string ω\\omegaω is derived **ambiguously** in context-free grammar G if it has two or more different **leftmost derivations**. Grammar G is ambiguous if it generates some string ambiguously.
> 
> ***leftmost derivation**: if at every step the leftmost remaining variable is the one replaced.

> **Theorem**  
> Any CFL is generated by a CFG in Chomsky normal form
